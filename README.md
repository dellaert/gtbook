- [A Trash Sorting
  Robot](https://www.roboticsbook.org/S20_sorter_intro.html)
  (`discrete`)

  (`vacuum`)
- [Warehouse Robots in
  2D](https://www.roboticsbook.org/S40_logistics_intro.html)
  (`logistics`)
- [A Mobile Robot with Simple
  Kinematics](https://www.roboticsbook.org/S50_diffdrive_intro.html)
  (`diffdrive`)
- [Autonomous
  Vehicles](https://www.roboticsbook.org/S60_driving_intro.html)
  (`driving`)
- [Autonomous Drones in

The structure of gtbook mirrors this organization, and then has a few
more support modules for displaying graphs inside notebooks and for
running the code in the book. The gtbook modules are listed above
alongside the chapter.

## How to use

In the book chapters, we should have a cell that fetches the latest
version using pip:

``` bash
%pip install -q -U gtbook
```

The above automatically installs other libraries on colab, e.g., gtsam
and plotly.

You also needs a cell that imports what you need in a particular
section, for example:

``` python
from gtbook.display import show
from gtbook.discrete import Variables
```

Further usage examples of these and more functions are given in the
module documentation itself.

There are also some command line tools defined in the `cli` module.

## Notes for development

> Mostly for Frank as he adds to the library.

- I used `conda install -c fastai nbdev` for version 2 of nbdev.
  Previously needed `pip3 install -U nbdev` as conda had old version.
- just do ‘make’ after changing any notebook.
- `pip install -e .` for local install for test purposes.

To release a new version:

- nbdev_bump_version
- make release
